# Why Circular

Human beings have been taking control over their food supply and living conditions already for the
past 10,000 years. However, since about the year 1900 many key parameters of human civilization
show what appears like an accelerated exponential growth (see box below).

Exponential growth is a feature of biological
systems that are not limited by resource scarcity
or predation. After an initial phase of uncontrolled
expansion, such populations may either
stabilize or collapse when their consumption
finally hits the limits of the available resources.
The difference between the two scenarios is in
whether critical resources are available mainly
as a stock (think of a fridge) or rather as a
continuously (re-)generated flow (like a garden).
Stabilization (or sustainability) occurs if all the
resources that are critical for the population’s
survival are continuously (re-)generated and
consumption balances the rate of regeneration.
In this case, population growth will flatten and
the size of the population converges gradually to
its maximum sustainable level (see figure below
for seals1). Populations crash if some critical resource was initially present as a large reservoir but with
no or only a minor rate of (re-)generation. In this case, the population will expand until the stock is
depleted. At this point, the size and consumption of the population cannot be sustained, and so it will
shrink abruptly to the level matching the low rate of (re-)generation.

Humans use biological and solar-based resources,
such as food, cotton and hydropower, along with
fossil fuels, metals and minerals. The first
resources have a relatively small reservoir and a
high rate of regeneration, while the last resources
are taken from large reservoirs and have a very
low rate of regeneration. This observation raises a
number of questions that will be studied in this
course:
* Which resources are critical for our standard
of living and when will we hit reservoirs’ limits?
* Can we replace coal, oil and gas by biological
and solar-based resources?
* Can we increase the rate of recycling of
metals and minerals resources?
* How do we reach sustainability (no depletion
of critical resources)?
