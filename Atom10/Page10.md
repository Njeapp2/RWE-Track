Products and services define a considerable part of the standard of living for citizens in modern
civilizations. In the past centuries, families increasingly outsourced the production of food, clothing,
housing, energy and tools to industry, and the consequent innovation of industrial production led to an
explosion of consumption. Thomas Piketty reports that the purchasing power of an average worker in
Europe increased 12-fold between 1820 and 2012[^1]: a sign of the large contribution of products and
services to today’s standard of living. Unfortunately, the use of resources also boomed during this same
period, so that some resources are now under stress. These resources are being used at a rate that
exceeds the biosphere’s capacity to (re-)generate them, and the first diplomatic, trade and military
conflicts around resources are a fact. Some governments are presently seeking ways to create the same
standard of living for their citizens while using less resources, in short: to be more resource-efficient[^2].

A first step towards that aim is to find a way to measure resource efficiency. In general, a measure for
the resource efficiency of a product, a service, an industry sector or of an entire society will have the
following form (X denotes the product, service, etc.):

The larger this ratio, the more consumer value is created for the same amount of resource stress. Of
course, this formula just shifts the problem from computing resource efficiency to the problems of
computing the contributions of a product or service to the standard of living and to resource stress.


Products and services continuously compete with each other on price and performance. This allows us
to state that market price reflects (is a proxy for) the contribution of products and services to the
standard of living. In other words, we can say that a €25 ticket for a circus performance is equivalent in
its contribution to the standard of living to a €25 hair dryer[^3]. The numerator in the formula for resource
efficiency can therefore be approximated by (the sum of) sales prices of products and services.

There exists no perfect indicator for resource stress. By using the cost of energy and materials in
production as a proxy for the resource stress created by a product of service, we account for stress
resulting from
1. the scarcity of resources,
2. the use of fossil fuels in materials and energy production,
3. pollution of the local environment associated with materials and energy (provided it is properly taxed),
4. positive societal externalities (provided they are properly subsidized).

With this approximation, the resource efficiency of a product becomes:

[^3]: Strictly, this is true only in a “linearized” or “marginal” sense. Citizens may, for example, exchange the joy of an ice cream for listening to a street music performance. It is not true in an absolute sense. A citizen cannot give up all food and replace it with buying electronic equipment. Therefore, prices of products will change with large shifts in consumption.
