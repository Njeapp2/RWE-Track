# Standardization

The Earthâ€™s biosphere is often taken as a model for a future circular economy of industrialized society, after the
original philosophy of architect Walter R. Stahel. The idea is that by studying the interplay of actors, driving
forces and materials in the biosphere we may learn how to design a regenerative industrial society. One of the
striking issues of the biosphere is, that, even though bio-organisms are the result of a billion years of random
mutations in an intense competition for resources, some building blocks of living tissue, notably 22 amino acids
for making proteins and eight nucleotides for making DNA and RNA, are standardized among (virtually) all
living beings. Apparently, using standard material components is not just an efficient strategy at the level of the
biosphere as a whole, but it is useful for every individual type of organism to comply with these standards.

The Nitrogen Cycle is a major cycle of the biosphere (see the figure below). Both animals and plants produce the
amino acids that they need, *in part* by synthesis from basic compounds such as ammonia, and *in part* by
recycling proteins by proteolysis. The last route is more energy-efficient than making amino acids by synthesis
routes. This is why it makes sense for all living beings to comply with the same standard set of amino acids,
since plant roots can then feed more efficiently (for example) on the fallen leaves of other plants and animals can
feed more efficiently on plants. Evidently, the loss of flexibility by using standard components and the more
complex and error-prone transfer of large molecules through membranes do not outweigh the gain in (energy)
efficiency for the individual organisms.

Industrial society differs in key aspects from the biosphere when it comes to the use of materials. Industries are
not constrained to use materials that are close at hand, but are able to transport materials from faraway deposits
or industrial production sites. Industries are also, to some extent, subject to societal rules. For a society as a
whole, using standardized materials may also create a more efficient circular economy. However, in contrast to
what is known from the biosphere, complying with standards is not always the optimal short term commercial
strategy for individual material producers while materials are still largely produced from fossil resources and
ores. Whether it is, depends on the societal organization of material cycles, in particular on whether it can be
made attractive for material producers to recover resources back from waste by financial incentives or
technology innovation.
