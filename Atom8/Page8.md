# Sorting Complex Wastes

Post-consumer wastes are waste flows originating from End-of-Life (EoL) products. Examples are
packaging waste from households, EoL vehicles and Waste from Electric and Electronic Equipment
(WEEE). Post-consumer wastes are often extremely complex, containing literally hundreds of different
materials: polymers of all kinds of grades and colours, metal alloys, as well as structured materials like
Printed Circuit Boards (PCBâ€™s) and types of coated glass. Shredding or cutting these wastes produces
particles of as many different materials and, on top of that, also non-liberated particles (particles
containing more than a single material). An important question for realising a circular economy is
whether pure materials can be recovered efficiently from complex wastes. A fundamental question is
how the effort of separating mixtures of particles scales with the number N of different materials.

### N - 1 Sorters in a line
The most intuitive way to answer this question is to assume that for each material there exists a
machine that is able to extract (virtually) all the particles of this material from the mix. Suppose that
separators are put in sequence; all separators have the same process capacity C [kg/s] and the mass of
the mixture is M [kg]. Then, theoretically, we need a process line of N - 1 machines for a period of
time M/C (see the figure below). So, the total effort (or sorting investment) in machine-hours is:
