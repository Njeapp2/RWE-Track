After a long period of stability in the 90â€™s, oil, metal and phosphate prices suddenly went through the
roof as the Chinese economy expanded to a world-class player in 2003-2007. The severe economic
crisis that followed did not bring prices back to former levels (see box below). The understanding that
future prices of resources and restricted access to mining deposits could hurt advanced economies
triggered an action of the European Commission towards resource efficiency in 2008.

Market prices for metals and minerals fluctuate
on a short timescale because mining operations
are not always able to respond quickly enough to
changes in demand. However, in the long term,
prices reflect the costs of production for the least
attractive (economically most marginal) mines
in actual operation. Several authors reported the
effect of resource depletion on the development
of the cost of mining operations in the last
decades. Australian BREE reported an average
downfall of 33% of mining efficiency (which
miners call multifactor productivity: MFP) that
was largely due to the depletion of indigenous
resources for the period 2000-20101. BREE also
concluded that Canadian and US mining
operations showed a similar average decrease of
metal production per unit input of labour and investment in that same period. G. Calvo et al.2 observed
that the average ore grade of 25 analysed copper mines, together representing 32% of world copper
production, went down by approx. 25% from 2003 to 2013.

Ore grade is an important parameter for the cost
of metal production. Therefore, future metal
prices could be estimated for different scenarios
of consumption if the decrease in ore grade
 kg metal/kg ore could be predicted as a
function of the cumulative amount  tons of
metal produced from the world ore bodies.
Studies of Australian mining by Gavin Mudd3
revealed the development of ore grade in the
20th century. Starting from about 1900, his noisy
data can be fit with various model functions, e.g.
with exponential or power law models,

c(p) = c_1900;  = 1900/1 + 

Note that for large values of P predictions differ
essentially (see box at left).
